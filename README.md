# Prototype
A minimally-functional prototype website to aid in development.


## Description
Why are these particular files there?

* `index.html`
* `prototype.css`
* `/images` because images are often cached, compressed, renamed, or have their EXIF metadata manipulated programmatically.
* `/fonts` because fonts are generally _truly_ static resources, which
* `/stylesheets` to hold other css. I generally keep the 'main' css in the webroot.
* `favicon.png`
* `apple-touch-icon.png`
* `robots.txt` is an unofficial standard that tells 'good' bots how to behave on your site, in particular, what parts of the site not to index.
